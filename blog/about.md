## end 2017

This blog site is the result of a presentation in which was shown how we can implement single page applications without using any frameworks.

Plain javascript without any frameworks? Is it possible? How much do we need to re-implement/re-invent, what about maintainability?

How do we call a javascript framework without being it a framework, so build my own blogging framework without calling it a framework. That's how I came up with the name Slatirous, wel actually github did it for me. When searching for a name for a repository I simple generated one, changed it a bit and used that as the name of the repo and the name of the framework.

So this blog site started as a proof of concept for implementing a application using JS only. With of course some CSS and html.

CSS, look-and-feel, not my cup of thee, so I used the [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp) templates for getting a decent user interface.

Why? Just because I can.

## mid 2019

The framework evolved more and more, with each time more knowledge about how to implement it and also with more and more requirements. Currently the blogging entry's including this about page is in a markdown format.

Headers, links, images, code blocks etc etc, are supported. The parser is not fully markdown compliant as I will only implement the requirements that I need.

The current plan for the side is to use it as my personal blogging platform.
