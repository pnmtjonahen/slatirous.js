### 05 Oct DL71 Amsterdam (AMS) - Atlanta, GA (ATL) 08:35-12:17

Early rise (03:00am) to catch the morning flight to Atlanta from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Long flight with nothing special happening, some food, some drinks, a movie or 2 and of course trying to get some sleep.  

### 05 Oct DL1180 Atlanta, GA (ATL) - Austin, TX (AUS) 14:55-16:18

Layover in Atlanta, as we did only have carry on luggage we where rather quick thru customs. When we bookd our tickets I took in account that entering the USA could take more then an hour. This time however it was done in under 10 minutes. And thus we had plenty of time for our transfer.
