## Saturday

### DL71 Amsterdam (AMS) - Atlanta, GA (ATL) 08:35-12:17

Early rise (03:00am) to catch the morning flight to Atlanta from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Long flight with nothing special happening, some food, some drinks, a movie or 2 and of course trying to get some sleep.  

### DL1180 Atlanta, GA (ATL) - Austin, TX (AUS) 14:55-16:18

Layover in Atlanta, as we did only have carry on luggage we where rather quick thru customs. When we bookd our tickets I took in account that entering the USA could take more then an hour. This time however it was done in under 10 minutes. And thus we had plenty of time for our transfer.

## Sunday

Today I had no sessions or workshops scheduled. After registration we went out and explored the city of Austin first order of the day was breakfast. After a nice walk we finally ended op at [caroline](https://www.carolinerestaurant.com/) where I ate a nice stack of buttermilk fluffy pancakes.

Next we went to see the Texas Capitol.

The day was finished at the Fairmont hotel swimming pool and finally diner at the [OP Italian restaurant](https://www.opitalianaustin.com/)

#### Austin TX
My impressions of Austin. First of all, and it might be due to being a Sunday I found the city quiet. Not a lot of traffic, either cars or people, with a temperature of around 100F or 35C, it was hot.

<<<

## Monday

Today was the first day of the conference where I was able to reserve a seat at a Hands-on lab.  

>>>

### 9:00am–11:00am Hands-on Knative

Nice two hour hands-on workshop on what is knative and how can we deploy, scale, do blue green deployments and events (functions) with [kubernates](https://kubernetes.io/) on google cloud platform using [knative](https://cloud.google.com/knative/).


As there was no breakfast and lunch we went out and had a burger at [max wine dive](https://maxswinedive.com/locations/austin/)
there slogan "Fried chicken with champagne, Heck why not!" made me laugh.

### 1:00pm–3:00pm [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/)

A rather in depth workshop on the internal working of [concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/), not what I was expecting/wanted/hoped for. As I do not have any concourse knowledge it went over my head. However it made me curious about concourse as a ci platform.

Need to check this out!

### 2:00pm-4:00pm Community Hub Opens

Today at 2:00pm the Community Hub opened. The community hub is located with in a big hall where also other events will take place, the Main Stage fore example is also located in the same hall. Made a round all the vendor stands, had some nice conversation with the vendors [White Source](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/), [Signal Sciences](https://www.signalsciences.com/), [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) and scored some swagg.

### 6:00pm=10:00pm Opening Reception in Community Hub
Reception with games, food and drinks, a lot of food and drinks.

### 7:00pm-8:00pm Lightning Talks
2 session of each 5 talks with 5 minutes per talk, automated slide advance. So the speaker had no way of influencing the speed of his talk. Some where funny, some where well prepared, others where difficult to follow, some technical and some not. You need to be there to understand.

Quote "Containers will not fix your culture!" some food for thought.

And also a hard to follow on the followup project for [hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki). Apparently hystrix is in maintenance mode and needs a successor. [resilience4j](https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs) is the answer.

## Tuesday

Starting the day with a burrito breakfast is a experience. Hot sauce in the morning, with coffee, and piña.

Opening of the SpringOne Platform with some very nice keynote speakers, actual to much to remember. Some highlights:

- VMware acquires Pivotal, still a work in progress but should be finished at the end of the Year.
- Microsoft + Pivotal, with a nice demo on deploying and running Spring Boot applications on Azure. With the introduction of Azure Spring Cloud. (Will this compete with CloudFoundry?)
- [Traihead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/home) and the need to educate the next generation. My take from this was "document more" everything that you figured out on your own, someone can benefit from it. A appeal to all attendants to get involved, write a blog, answer questions in a community and present at a conference. Have companies create the environment to enable this, which made me proud to be at Ordina, as that is exactly what our CodeSmith program is about.
- LOL, basic human needs include WiFi and battery.  
- We as humans are need driven, as long as there is still a need we do things, this also applies to software development.


### 11:30am–12:40pm Spring Framework 5.2: Core Container Revisited
Juergen Hoeller

Very good session on v5.2 of Spring with some insights of what has happened, like good Java 8 support throughout the whole core of spring, making use of all the Java 8 features and getting rid of old code.

- Nullability implemented where needed, and used to get rid of extra null checks.
- ObjectProvider class, with all the new possible API's, stream, @nullable etc.
- Performance improvements, and the notion of programatically setting up your spring context. (aka get rid of the component scan).
- GraalVM support, (5.1 prepare for GraalVM, 5.2 custom setup, 5.3 out-of-the-box)
- Reactive setup with R2DBC, RSocket

> jdk9 flow API, need to do a follow up on that

### 2:00pm–3:10pm Do’s and Don’ts: Avoiding First-Time Reactive Programmer Mines
Sergei Egorov

Learn functional programming, or better do understand the whole of java stream API, more like imperative vs functional than the actual functional programming languages, understand lazy evaluation. Nothing happens until you do a collect on the stream.

> Subscribe in code is a code smell!

Understand immutability of reactive operators. Always return result of the operator and always used that returned value. Use high-order function like flatMap or filter, instead create your of methods. Also use the correct method for the job ad hand, there are more methods then just map, flatMap and filter, even for map there can be alternatives like map vs handle, or flatMap vs concatMap or switchMap or flatMapSequential.

Remember that for reactor every thing is a queue, flatmap, map etc are queued which has some overhead, A plain for loop to calculate something can be faster then a reactive variant.

When using a blocking call, like a JDBC call have it run on a special thread pool, else the whole reactive thread pool might become blocked.

> Do prepare for day 2, shit happens

Checkout .checkpoint operations or Hooks.onOperatorDebug or ReactorDebugAgent.init() these will add debugging information in the stacktrace in case an error occurs.

#### Do...

- Learn functional programmings
- Check various operators
- Think about the resiliency
- Start gradually
- Prepare for Day 2

#### Don't...
- Use it for heavy computation
- Care about threads
- Block non-blocking threads
- Use ThreadLocals
- Be afraid of it

### 4:20pm–5:30pm Eighteen Years of Spring
Rod Johnson

Nice presentation of the top 10 things that we can learn from 18 years of spring. The things that wen right and also the things that wen wrong.

From coding standards, to community, opensource, correct covernance, and the fight about what is right and what is wrong.

### the night
After the last session we went to [stagger lee](https://thestaggerlee.com/) for the EMEA BBQ party. After enjoying some BBQ and drinks.  

<<<

## Wednesday

Breakfast with beagles, egg, bacon and coffee, thats the way to start the day. Had a nice conversation over breakfast, touched some politics. Even they don't understand how they got there current coverment. The difference between driving in the US and driving in the Netherlands, and our stereotypes, Dutch vs US.

>>>

### 9:00am-11:00am Main Stage

Morning main stage session hosted by Josh Long, with some speakers from The Home Depot, Netflix and GM. And a demo on reactor, reactive [r2dbc](https://r2dbc.io/) database drivers.

The Home Depot was more a story on how they migrated from a typical retail company into a software supported company. Of course using SpringBoot applications.

Netflix had a nice presentation about what they initially build them self, donated that to Spring and are now micrating all there applications into spring boot applications using there own donated code. At the moment are around 20% of all there java software is migrated. Now that's what I call full circle open source.
Also interesting to hear is that Netflix not only build software supporting the streaming service, but also the software for creating the Netflix original content.

### 11:30am–12:40pm Designing a Reactive System
Ryland Degnan, Stephane Maldini, Andy Shi.

This was a different setup then the normal 3 guys and a slide deck, where each of them takes a turn on presenting something. 3 guys on chairs as in a panel discussion, but now based on a single slide each of them explains there take on it.

Designing microservices can be split up in two different categories, the one where we have a legacy system that needs to be migrated, and on the other side the new to build applications. Each have there own approach. But also different problems. Applying the same rules for greenfield microservices on a migration will result in different issues/problems to be solved

So what is the cloud native wish list when we would start greenfield.

###### Expressive
- Developers want to take advantage of interaction types beyond request/response (streaming, push, realtime data processing)
###### Comprehensive
- Applications do not consist solely of backend services, increasing need to extend to edge, serverless, mobile and web.
###### Reactive
- Build modern, cloud native applications requires reactive systems that are responsive, resilient, elastic and message driven.

You need back pressure!

What RSocket delivers

###### Expressive
- out of the box support for request-response and streaming, resumability and cancellation of streams.
###### Comprehensive
- Clients in every language, including mobile and browsers
- works with any transport in any environment (Bare metal, VMs, k8s, etc)
###### Reactive
- Reactive flow control eliminates complex configuration

### 2:00pm–3:10pm Performance Monitoring Backend and Frontend Using Micrometer
Clint Checketts

During the morning session somebody called it mi-crometer, the speacker started with Micro-meter or Mi-crometer whatever you want, he however pronounced it as Micro-Meter

Very nice presentation with a lot of demo's, even though it was all in kotlin, it still showed all the things he wanted to explain. The first demo was to show what was possible and what API'swhere available.

The spring demo actual showed the same but then with all the spring defaults, resulting in almost the same functionality as the first one.

Spring Micrometer Integration
- Build into Spring
- Autowired by Spring
- Integration provided by micrometer
- Integration provided by the library
- Custom stuff

Some other pointers
###### dimensional metrics vs hierarchical.

hierarchical:
server1.http.requests = 10
us-east.blue.server1.http.request.200.users = 10

dimensional:
http_requests{server="server1"} 10
http_requests{server="server1",
          region="us-east",
          cluster="blue",
          status="200",
          uri="users"} 10

Both dimensional and hierarchical counters are about the same metric, http_request count, however adding extra information about the counter is in a dimensional way much easier and far more extensible.

###### The parts of what observability is and some implementations
- logging (log4j)
- metrics (Micrometer)
- tracing (Zipkin)

Tagging metrics, don't use user input, and use a RestTemplate with parameters
http_request{uri="users/{id}"} 10

vs

http_request{uri="users/1"} 1
http_request{uri="users/2"} 1
http_request{uri="users/3"} 1
http_request{uri="users/4"} 1

the second one will break your metrics and with a high number of users can even result in out-of-memory.

###### Some sideline mentioned things
> HealthIndicator interface
> @cacheable

These need a followup.

### 4:20pm–5:30pm Reactive Architectures with RSocket and Spring Cloud Gateway
Spencer Gibb, Cora Iberkleid

Very nice presentation and demo of the Spring Cloud Gateway with [RSocket](http://rsocket.io/)

When using the Spring Gateway with RSocket you don't need to:
- Ingress permissions
- Separate Service Discovery
- Circuit Breaker
- Client-side load balancer
- Sidecar
- Startup order problems
- Special case for warmup
- Message broker

With the demo they showed all of the above. One side note it all is still in beta, but to me looked very promising.

Unfortunately the was to much wind and after almost 3 hours waiting we gave up. Fortunately there was a guy with a night vision (infrared) scope, So we did see them only where not able to take pictures. Maybe tomorrow.

## Thursday

Last day of the conference, nice breakfast, with coffee, this time in a different hall, as the exhibition hall was already being cleaned.

### 9:00am-11:00am Main Stage

The last keynote of the week, unfortunately it showed, presentations of how different companies use spring boot and spring cloud to enable them to build software, nothing major, no rocket science.

### 10:30am–11:40am JUnit 5: Evolution and Innovation
Sam Brannen

All the new and shining things that is included in jUnit Jupiter, aka jUnit5. New extension mechanism, new life cycle methods etc etc.

With a demo on the new DisplayNameGenerator, where you can automatically generate display names based on your method names, eg replace underscores with spaces to make a test method like a_test_that_verify_my_method to be displayed as "a test that verify my method". sounds to me like a real must have.

The @DisplayName annotation is one I don't get. Why would I annotate my test class or test method with a display name, Isn't that the same thing as adding comments in code? 

```code
@DisplayName("The FizzBuzz Test")
public class FizzBuzzTest {

    @DisplayName("test FizzBuzz")
    public void testFizzBuzz() {

....
```

Shouldn't our test classes and test methods have a clear and meaningful name?

Random ordering your test methods using @TestMethodOrder(Random.class) to make sure that there is no dependency between different test methods sounds like plan.

@Timeout annotation to test for long running methods and have a timeout if they take to long. So we could make sure that a method will not run longer that x seconds. 

###### Spring
Jupiter also works for older 4.x spring framework, not official supported but it works. Also the SpringBoot test annotations already include the jupiter extension annotations, no extra annotation is needed.

### 12:30pm–1:00pm Spring Cloud Gateway for Stateless Microservice Authorization
Chris Jackson, Saravana Prarmasivam

Starting with a migration from monolith to microserver, in particular security aspects like authentication and authorization. How did they solve it at Ameritrade.
Lots of pro/cons of all kind of solutions bud eventual ended up with an API gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway.

Use Open Id Connect and/or OAuth based authentication using JWT tokens.

### Lady Bird Lake Hike-and-Bike Trail

After lunch we went out for a walk and ended up at the hotel pool.

Saw a red-cheeked tortoise

### DL2241 Austin, TX (AUS) - Atlanta, GA (ATL) 14:00-17:10
Uneventful flight to Atlanta, quick security check and little wait.

### DL74 Atlanta, GA (ATL) - Amsterdam (AMS) 20:08-10:45+1
At Atlanta, just take the flighttrain to the international terminal. No security checks no passport checks, no extra whatever, which is in stark contrast with entering the USA.

Long flight with just under 4 hours of sleep. A movie and where back home. O and by the way it is sunday.

## Sunday
Home, hard time to stay awake.
